# Thesis
Supervised machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines and feedforward neural networks are often used in the context of clinical risk prediction. This thesis investigates whether or not there are substantial gains in performance over traditional statistical techniques like logistic regression in this context.

In terms of file structure, all the notebooks sits in the same level, with the mortality data file in a path ./data.

Should you wish to run the data reading yourself, the data is all available from the 2007-2008 NHANES wave linked: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2007. The raw data files should be saved in the path ./data/raw_data_files

A complete list of the data files used is in the readme for the data reading scripts.
