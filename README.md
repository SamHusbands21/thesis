# thesis
Supervised machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines and feedforward neural networks are often used in the context of clinical risk prediction. This thesis investigates whether or not there are substantial gains in performance over traditional statistical techniques like logistic regression in this context.

In terms of file structure, all the notebooks sit in one place, with the mortality data file in a path ./data/2007.

The code is presented in jupyter notebooks to aid readability.
